# Inheritance

In java, inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based
on an existing class. That means the new subclass can inherit all the
fields and methods of the superclass, and can also add new fileds and 
methods or override existing one.

```java
public subclass extends superclass{
    //fields and methods of subclass
}
```
